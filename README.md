This is a comparative analysis on  Forecasting Precipitation (rain) in Chennai.
<BR><br>
We have done Data collection,Data Cleaning,Feature and Target Definition,Data Spiltting,Model Training and Model Evaluation.
<BR><br>
The models used here are Decision tree,CatBoost,XgBoost,LightGBM,BiLSTM,Random Forest.
<br>The evaluation metrics used are Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE)
, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R^2 score ; and arrived at the conclusion that Random Forest generates the least MAE value of 2.633 than compared to other models.
<BR><br>
Random Forest handles complex patterns, works with incomplete data, avoids overfitting, and performs well on large datasets.
