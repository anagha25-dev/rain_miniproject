THIS IS A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ON  FORECASTING PRECIPITATION (RAIN) IN CHENNAI.
<BR>
WE HAVE DONE DATA COLLECTION,DATA CLEANING,FEATURE AND TARGET DEFINITION,DATA SPLITTING,MODEL TRAINING AND MODEL EVALUATION.
<BR>
THE MODELS USED HERE ARE DECISION TREE,RANDOM FOREST,LIGHT-GBM,CATBOOST,XGBOOST,BiLSTM.
THE EVALUATION METRIC  USED HERE IS MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR (MAE) ,MEAN SQUARED ERROR (MSE) , ROOT MEAN SQUARED ERROR (RMSE) AND R^2 SCORE. WE CHOOSED MAE VALUE AS THE FINAL EVALUATION AND OBTAINED THAT THE LEAST MAE WAS OBTAINED FOR RANDOM FOREST WITH THE VALUE OF 2.6633. 
<BR><strong>
Random Forest handles complex patterns, works with incomplete data, avoids 
    overfitting, and performs well on large datasets.</strong>
